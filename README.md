# Aws utils

Collection of code snippets used for AWS (S3/EMR and so on).

## Testing

We should aim > 90% test coverage, having at least one full
integration test for each function.

To make it more clear tests should be split in the *unit* and
*integration* directory.

This project should be made working both with Python2.7 and Python>=3.4
so making sure all the libraries declared here are Python3 Friendly.
